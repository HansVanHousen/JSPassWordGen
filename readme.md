screenshot of git issue. I had finished this project, and then when I went to make a push to my remote repo I got a bunch of erros. I had a TA help, but then it happened again, and then  tutor tried and failed to fix it easily, so I am now just coping and pasting the content over. This screenshot is really just to show that I had been making commits over the course of a few days, and not all within 20 minutes.
